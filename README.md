# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview 
Understand machine learning using unsupervised algorithms, which is used when we are not sure what we are lookig for.

This module has taught me the following:

1. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Clustering and the K-means Algorithm
4. Using the Elbow Curve to Find Centroids 
5. Managing Data Features
6. Hierarchical Clustering

# Module 18 Challenge 

## Challenge Summary
We are to present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing this new investment product.

We will be using unsupervised learning,clustering algorithm, to group the cryptocurrencies and making visualization to share with the board. 

## Challenge overview

1. Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
2. Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
3. Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
4. Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

## Summary

Please view the Module18_Challenge.ipynb to see the visualizations
